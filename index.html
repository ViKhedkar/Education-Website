                     character traits.
                     There are many debates about
                     its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve.</p>

            in some subjects but to develop in him those habits and attitudes with which he may 
            successfully face the future. So education does not merely mean to be able to read and 
            write, rather it is a process of the harmonious development of an individual. M.k. Gandhi, 
            therefore, defined education as‚Äù A process that brings out the best in human beings body, 
            mind, and spirit.
            It is an essential tool for enhancing social development. It is essential 
            to promote change and development in society. To improve the economic condition 
            of a country to exploit means and resources at the optimum level and to maintain
             brotherhood in society, education is a must. United Nations defines education as 
             fundamental to enhancing to quality of human life and ensuring social and economic 
             progress.

            Education in India
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed 
            by the state-run public education system, which falls under the command 
            of the government at three levels: central, state and local. 
            Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free 
            and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
             fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number 
             of public
             schools to private schools in India is 10:3.[7]

            Pre-primary education
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The pre-primary stage is the foundation of children's
             knowledge, skills and behaviour. On completion of pre-primary education, the children are sent to 
             the primary stage but pre-primary education in India is not a fundamental right. In rural India,
              pre-primary schools are rarely available in small villages. But in cities and big towns, there
               are many established players in the pre-primary education sector. The demand for the preschools 
               is growing considerably in the smaller towns and cities but still,
             only 1% of the population under age 6 is enrolled in preschool education.
